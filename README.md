# lein-hadoop

This is a plugin for [Leiningen][0] which generates a jar suitable for
submission as a [Hadoop][1] job. Specifically, this is a runable jar
with <tt>lib/</tt> containing all project dependencies. The contents
of <tt>lib/dev</tt> are excluded.

The name of the generated jar can be overridden by specifying a custom
value for <tt>:hadoop-name</tt> or <tt>:jar-name</tt> in project.clj.

You can use this plugin to build any Hadoop application which requires
a runable jar, including projects using [MapReduce][2],
[Cascading][3], and [Cascalog][4].

## Installation

Add to your project.clj

    :dev-dependencies [[lein-hadoop "1.1.0"]]

## Usage

    $ lein clean, deps, hadoop
